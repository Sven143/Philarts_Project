                    <h1>JUAN F. NAKPIL</h1>
                    <br><b>PERSONAL BACKGROUND:</b><br>
                        - Juan Felipe Nakpil was born on May 26, 1899, the eldest child of Julio Nakpil 
                    and Gregoria De Jesus. Julio Nakpil was a musician and composer who fought 
                    in the Philippine Revolution against Spain and had been designated by Andres 
                    Bonifacio as secretary of the command in the north of Manila. He later married 
                    Bonifacio’s widow, Gregoria, who was also a courageous leader of the 
                    Katipunan. While he also trained to play the piano, Juan’s inclination to the 
                    visual arts must have been boosted when as a child in 1907, he won the silver 
                    medal in a Rizal Day drawing competition. He further trained in freehand 
                    drawing with Fabian de la Rosa and Fernando Amorsolo, then already 
                    distinguished artists, and would have been inspired by his aunt Petrona 
                    Nakpil-Bautista, who excelled in painting. The Nakpil family was also known 
                    for the Plateria Nakpil, where fine jewelry was designed and crafted.<br><br>

                    <br><b>EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND:</b><br>
                        - He studied engineering at the University of California and later, at the 
                    University of Kansas, where he received his bachelor's degree in Mechanical 
                    Engineering. He then studied architecture at the Fontainebleau School of Fine 
                    Arts in France upon the recommendation of Jean Jacques Haffner, one of his 
                    professors at the Harvard Graduate School of Architecture.<br><br>

                    <br><b>CAREER:</b><br>
                        - Nakpil worked at Andres Luna de San Pedro's architectural firm (1928) and at 
                    Don Gonzalo Puyat & Sons, opening his own architectural firm in 1930. Among 
                    Nakpil's works are San Carlos Seminary, Geronimo de los Reyes Building, 
                    Iglesia ni Cristo Riverside Locale (Now F. Manalo, San Juan), Magsaysay 
                    Building, Rizal Theater, Capitol Theater, Captain Pepe Building, Manila Jockey 
                    Club, Rufino Building, Philippine Village Hotel, University of the Philippines 
                    Administration and University Library, and the Rizal Shrine in Calamba, 
                    Laguna. He also designed the International Eucharistic Congress altar and 
                    improved the Quiapo Church in 1930 by erecting a dome and a second belfry. 
                    The church burned down in 1929 prior to Nakpil's redesign of the building. In 
                    the 1930s to the 1940s, Nakpil and his fellow architects Andres Luna de San 
                    Pedro, Fernando Ocampo and Pablo Antonio started the period of modern 
                    architecture in the Philippines. Nakpil and others also established the 
                    Philippine College of Design in 1941 but the institution did not survive the 
                    Second World War. In 1952, President Quirino appointed Nakpil to be a 
                    member of the National Rizal Day Committee. He was hailed as a National 
                    Artist for Architecture in 1973. On November 23, 1936, Nakpil was on a list of 
                    Inactive Philippine Army Officers as an Infantry Major.<br><br>

                    <br><b>CONTRIBUTIONS:</b><br>
                        - Nakpil’s greatest contribution is his belief that there is such a thing as 
                    Philippine Architecture, espousing architecture reflective of Philippine 
                    traditions and culture.<br><br>

                    <br><b>AWARDS AND/OR DISTICTIONS RECEIVED:</b><br>
                        - The Republic Cultural Heritage Award was presented to Nakpil and his sons in 
                    1971. He also got the Rizal Pro Patria Award in 1972. Then finally, on June 12, 
                    1973, he was named as A National Artist of the Philippines. And that is all his 
                    recognitions.<br><br><br><br><br>

                    design. He was cited for taking Philippine architecture into a new direction, 
                    with "clean lines, plain surfaces, and bold rectangular masses." Antonio strove 
                    to make each building unique, avoiding obvious trademarks.<br><br>

                    <h1>LEANDRO V. LOCSIN</h1>
                    <br><b>PERSONAL AND EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND:</b><br>
                        - Leandro Valencia Locsin was born on August 15, 1928, in Silay, Negros 
                    Occidental, a grandson of the first governor of the province. He completed his 
                    elementary education De La Salle College in Manila before returning to Negros 
                    due to the Second World War. He then returned to Manila to finish his 
                    secondary education in La Salle and proceeded in taking up Pre-Law before

                    Montojo. The latter recommended Locsin to the Ossorio family that was 
                    planning to build a chapel in Negros. When Frederic Ossorio left for the United 
                    States, the plans for the chapel were canceled

                    relatively cheap in the Philippines and easy to form, for his buildings. In 1969, 
                    he completed what was to be his most recognizable work, the Theater of 
                    Performing Arts (now the Tanghalang Pambansa) of the Cultural Center of the 
                    Philippines. The marble façade of the building is cantilevered 12 meters from 
                    the terrace by huge arching columns at the sides of the building, giving it the 
                    impression of being afloat. A large lagoon in front of the theatre mirrors the 
                    building during daytime, while fountains are illuminated by underwater lights 
                    at nighttime. The building houses four theaters, a museum of ethnographic art 
                    and other temporary exhibits, galleries, and a library on Philippine art and 
                    culture.

                        - José María V. Zaragoza (December 6, 1912-1994) was a Filipino architect.
                    <br><br>

                    <br><b>CAREER:</b><br>
                        - During the earlier years of his career, Zaragoza had meetings with American 
                    architect Frank Lloyd Wright culminating with a visit to Wright' atelier in 
                    Arizona in the United States in 1956. However, unlike his contemporaries, 
                    Zaragoza looked into European architecture for inspiration instead of drawing 
                    from American architecture.

                        - José Maria Zaragoza played a key role in the reconstruction of postwar 
                    Philippines, helping reshape the landscape of Manila ravaged by the Second 
                    World War through his striking structures that melded modernism and 
                    Philippine motifs and styles.
