                          <p>Learning about how art is an essential part in the main structure of a nation and that it also ensures democracy amongst the people, this is the most important lesson for me as art is omnipresent in our day to day life. When citizens have great pride in their cultural heritage, they are bound to be active agents in nation building.</p>

                                  <p>The most important lesson I learned from Sir Lex's lesson is "Contemporary art." because it is significant in the lives of Filipinos Every work of contemporary art reflects someone's feelings, ideas, or points of view. Contemporary art allows Filipinos to express themselves in a way that others can safely observe. It is a form of personal expression.</p>

                                      <p>My favorite and important lesson i've leaned is the different forms of art 
                                        because I thought that art was just painting, the word art covers a lot</p>

                <h4>Role that ONA Plays in the Cultural Heritage of the Philippines</h4>
                <p>- Emerging artists from the Philippines plays a significant role in the Philippine's cultural heritage. This is where ONA comes to play as its main purpose is to promote and encourage them. ONA or Order of the National Artist is the most Honorable Award an Artist can receive, it embodies the nation's ideals in humanism and aesthetic expression through Architecture, Literature  Dance, Theater and etc. The promotion of art in a nation plays an important role in the  cultural heritage of one's nation in this case the Philippines.</p>
